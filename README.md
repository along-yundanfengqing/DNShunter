# DNShunter
DNShunter is a python based module that is written for MercenaryHuntFramework &amp; Mercenary-Linux.  Currently it reads in .pcap files and extracts the DNS Queries and Answers.  In addition to extracting the queries &amp; answers, it also performs a geo-lookup of the domains &amp; the associated IP's.  This makes it easy to catch attacks such as DNS Cache Poisoning and DNSBeacons.
